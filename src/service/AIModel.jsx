Remember to replace placeholder image URLs with real ones.\n* **Geocoordinates:** Added geocoordinates for hotels and places.\n* **Ticket Pricing:**  Included example ticket prices (these are estimates, actual costs may differ).  Free for beaches and exploring towns, but costs apply for tours and some attractions.\n* **Time to Travel:** Added estimated travel times between locations to make planning more practical.\n* **Best Time to Visit:** Added a general \"best time to visit\" section to the `tripDetails`.\n* **7-Day Itinerary (Adaptable):** I've given a 3-day itinerary as requested, but it can easily be expanded to 7 days.  You can repeat activities, explore other beaches (Flic en Flac, Belle Mare),  visit  natural parks (Black River Gorges National Park), or add more activities like hiking, diving, etc.  Just duplicate the day structure and add new place objects.\n* **Image URLs:** I've used placeholder URLs (`https://example.com/...`).  Replace these with actual image links.\n\n\n**To use this JSON effectively:**\n\n1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace example data (image URLs, potentially hotel pricing) with accurate information.  Use hotel booking sites and tourism websites for updated details.\n2. **Map Integration:** This data is ideal for use with map APIs (e.g., Google Maps, Leaflet). The geocoordinates allow you to display the locations visually.\n3. **Dynamic Display:**  You can use JavaScript or other programming languages to parse this JSON and display it nicely on a website or in a mobile app.\n4. **Expand the Itinerary:** Fill in the rest of the 7-day itinerary using the provided structure.  Research more places in Mauritius and add them as needed.\n\n\nThis improved JSON now provides a more complete structure for a Mauritius travel app or website and a more practical starting point for planning. Remember to keep the data updated!"},
